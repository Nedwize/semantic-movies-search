## Things to talk about

1. Architecture of the application - MongoDB + Vector
    1. People think we have to move entire databases to Vector Stores
    2. We do not have to do that
2. Store vectors in DBs - ChromaDB
    1. Why are we using ChromaDB
3. SBERT models and their perf, size, use-case
4. Codebase is open source, please try it out, optimise it, raise a PR

# TODO
